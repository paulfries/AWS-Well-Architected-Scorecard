			<h1 class="text-center"><b>Getting to Innovation Faster</b></h1><br>
			<p >Well-Architected Scorecard is web portal that measures the progress and maturity of a product against establisted well-architected principles. This allows us to::</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gather maturity data about multiple applications simultaneously</li>
				<li>Use a common set of standards to drive business results</li>
				<li>Increase visibility to the broader organization for better decision making</li>
				<li>Gravitate towards consistency across teams and products</li>
				<li>Solicit improtant information from application teams directy with and easy-to-use interface</li>
				<li>Invest in addressing specific target areas prior to cloud migration</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="text-justify">Well-Architected Scorecard helps us determine the maturity of an application or an architecture against the AWS Well-Architected Framework.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">The model charts a clear path that can be completed in stages and allows flexibility for progressing through five key dimensions of the Well-Architectred framework: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">For an organization's move to the public cloud, the model serves as a “cloud readiness" gauge that quantifies how close a product is to being ready for migration, and how well it can be maintained once migrated. This is achieved by establishing targets for a subset of capabilities that we believe define the minimum requirements for any product or service in the public cloud. This gives teams who own legacy products a clear goal to work toward that they can easily track. It also allows the company to operate in a decentralized, self-service way so that teams can run with their migrations without delay.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">You can’t tell if you’re winning without a scoreboard, so we created a portal to gather, aggregate, and display patterns from the data assembled and made it visible to everyone in the company. Strategically, Well-Architected Scorecard provides a key indicator of performance so that we can continually make value-driven improvements.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">The best thing about our model is that it does not prescribe solutions. Rather, it offers standards with an aim to give teams a clear path towards efficient product development at scale. This tool is NOT a replacement for a formal Well-Architected Review, rather it provides a method for rapid "high-level" assessment of many applications prior to migration. It is expected that a formal review will take place post-migration. </p>

			<h1 class="text-center"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h1><br><br>

			<h3 id="question1" class="about-header"><b>What is Well-Architected Scorecard?</b></h3><br>
			<p class="text-justify">Well-Architected Scorecard values automation, repeatability, and visibility over manual, repetitive tasks. The Well-Architected Scorecard well-architected model represents a set of standards for applications teams to target as part of their development and maturity. When teams de-prioritize these standards, they accept the risk of paying “tax” later in the form of fighting fires, longer release cycles, and limited visibility into the health and performance of the product. By investing time to remove these distractions from occurring in the first place, teams find that they have more time to put towards what they love most...building awesome products for our customers</p>
			<p class="text-justify">Simply put, Well-Architected Scorecard helps teams identify growth opportunities for their products by eliminating waste, prepare for the AWS migration, and “level up” to the ultimate goal: continuous delivery.</p>

			<h3 id="question2" class="about-header"><b>How can an organization use this data to drive innovation?</b></h3><br>
			<p class="text-justify">Well-Architected Scorecard represents the prioritization of where we want to be as a technology-focused organization. We use this data to gain insight and visibility into our product portfolio and infrastructure footprint so we can make data-based decisions around strategic investments that “level up” maturity across the company.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">At any large organization, we've found it far more efficient to have product teams self-assess their products to determine growth opportunities and set goals to achieve them. Based on the scores, products are given a “cloud readiness” rating and teams use the data to help inform their roadmap eg. list of items to address in preparation for migrating off on-prem infrastructure to the public cloud. </p><br>

			<h3 id="question3" class="about-header"><b>How can teams use this data?</b></h3><br>
			<p class="text-justify">Convincing a Product or Business Owner why time should be prioritized towards initiatives that are often considered "tech tasks" can be difficult, especially when unarmed with the facts. The Well-Architected Scorecard well-architected model is designed to be a communication tool for teams to quantify value and justify the work needed to improve their technology.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">Equipped with this data, you can now negotiate for prioritization by using the argument “if we invest X amount of time improving our test suite, we will get back the X amount of time wasted on manual tests every release." Now, that’s a compelling argument anyone can get behind!</p><br>

			<h3 id="question4" class="about-header"><b>How was the Well-Architected Scorecard well-architected model created?</b></h3><br>
			<p class="text-justify">During a large scale migration project, we took note of the patterns that made deploying to a new environment challenging for many teams. We ended up creating a punch list of barriers preventing teams from achieving continuous delivery. During initial research, we found that the existing models didn’t address the pain points felt by most teams, so...we created our own! We incorporated AWS's Well-Architected Framework into Established IT architecture principles, and built this tool to assist in the data gathering phase.</p><br>

			<h3 id="question5" class="about-header"><b>What does the “cloud readiness” score mean?</b></h3><br>
			<p class="text-justify">The gauge indicates the cloud readiness of the product in reference to the minimum capabilities we feel are necesWell-Architectedy to run natively in the public cloud. Teams can prepare for running efficiently in the public cloud by bringing their score up to 100%.</p><br>

			<h3 id="question6" class="about-header"><b>What is considered a “product” in Well-Architected Scorecard?</b></h3><br>
			<p>Here’s how we think about Products within the scope of this application:<br><br>
			<b>Product:</b>
			<p>Product (product line / product family) is a marketable entity that delivers the primary investment or business value.</p>
			<b>Component:</b><br>
			<p>Component is a service or major component within the product line / marketable product that powers and enables its clients to use the product functionality or features e.g. input and output endpoints.</p><br>
			<b>Subcomponent:</b><br>
			<p>Subcomponent is a deployable package, if the component breaks down into multiple packages, or the underlying data services or data stores that fuel or support the components e.g. database.</p><br>

	<h1>Getting to Innovation Faster</h1><br>
	<p >Well-Architected Scorecard is an open source portal that measures the progress and maturity of their product allowing companies of any size to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Spend more time innovating, and less time being “busy” with repetitive, manual tasks</li>
		<li>Use a common set of standards to drive business results</li>
		<li>Increase visibility for better decision making</li>
		<li>Gravitate towards consistency across teams and products</li>
		<li>Use standard components over custom-built solutions</li>
		<li>Invest in fixing root causes and not just the symptoms</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Well-Architected Scorecard helps us identify growth opportunities to eliminate waste, set clearly defined targets, and measure progress all while we work toward the ultimate goal of continuous delivery.</p>
	<p>The model charts a clear path that can be completed in stages and allows flexibility for progressing through five key dimensions of software development: Code, Build & Test, Release, Operate, and Optimize.</p>
	<p>For Ticketmaster’s move to the public cloud, the model served as a “cloud readiness" gauge that quantifies how close a product is to being ready for migration. This was achieved by establishing targets for a subset of capabilities that we believe define the minimum requirements for any product or service in the public cloud. This gives teams who own legacy products a clear goal to work toward that they can easily track. It also allows the company to operate in a decentralized, self-service way so that teams can run with their migrations without delay.</p>
	<p>You can’t tell if you’re winning without a scoreboard, so we created a portal to gather, aggregate, and display patterns from the data assembled and made it visible to everyone in the company. Strategically, Well-Architected Scorecard provides a key indicator of our performance so that we can continually make value-driven improvements.</p>
	<p>The best thing about our model is that it does not prescribe solutions. Rather, it offers standards with an aim to give teams a clear path towards efficient product development at scale. The model can be easily tailored to meet your specific needs. Ticketmaster has technology ranging from the 1970’s to today, and we have been able to successfully apply this model to products ranging from VAX code to JavaScript libraries. It’s a great vehicle for sharing and rallying around a common vision</p>
	<p>We’re excited to see the response from the community, and are thrilled to share this tool with others.</p>

	<h3 id="question5"><b>What does the “cloud %” gauge on the detail page mean?</b></h3><br>
	<p>The gauge indicates the cloud readiness of the product in reference to the <a href="https://contegixapp1.livenation.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?title=Minimum+Tech+Maturity+Standards+for+AWS+Migration&spaceKey=AWS">AWS Minimum Well-Architected Scorecard Standards</a>. Teams can prepare for the AWS migration by bringing their score up to 100%.</p><br>

	<h3 id="question6"><b>What is considered a “product” in Well-Architected Scorecard?</b></h3><br>
	<p>At the team level, Well-Architected Scorecard focuses on the products that each delivery team owns. In this context, a product is a separate piece of code that can be deployed independently. We like to call them “deployable code units” in the guided assessments.</p><p>At the portfolio management level, the “deployable code units” are considered to be a component or sub-component of what the business considers to be a top-level product (e.g. Order Bridge V3 is a component of Commerce Platform).</p><br>

	<h3 id="question7"><b>How was the list of products created?</b></h3><br>
	<p>Historically, Ticketmaster has not had a clear understanding of the products within its portfolio, where they are hosted, and who is responsible for supporting them. This is due to the scale at which we operate, disparate data sources, and the lack of centralized repository for this information.</p><p>We have now captured knowledge of Ticketmaster’s products, broken down into components with basic information such as ownership, business priority, and category and stored the information in a centralized place called Product Search. We created this tool to prevent the data from going stale and ensure it was transparent and available to everyone. Product Search is a proof-of-concept to hold us by until the <a href="https://contegixapp1.livenation.com/confluence/display/LT/XB.9.2+Product+Inventory+Management">Product Inventory Management</a> system (PIM) is released. PIM is focused on delivering a centralized 'source of truth' for Ticketmaster products and asset associations, with the ability to extend to future attributes such as Tech & Team Maturity. We can use this data to gain insight and visibility into our infrastructure footprint and product portfolio to make better investment decisions.</p><p>Notice a theme here? All of the <a href="https://contegixapp1.livenation.com/confluence/display/LT/Goal+XB.9+-+Simplify+the+Software+Factory">Simplify the Software Factory</a> (SSF) initiatives are interrelated and designed to move the company towards continuous delivery.</p><br>

	<h3 id="question8"><b>What should I expect during a guided Well-Architected Scorecard assessment?</b></h3><br>
	<p>Well-Architected Scorecard assessments are casual gatherings that begin with an overview on the process and benefits for the team. The list of products will be reviewed to make sure that we're not missing anything and then we dive in! During the assessment, a document is shared on Zoom and updated as self-assessments are given. Any questions on what certain capabilities mean, or the rationale behind them, will be addressed live during the session.</p><p>In conclusion, the team will receive a copy of the results on this website (usually on the same day).</p><p>Once a team has completed a guided assessment, they are now trained on the process and can maintain the document independently. Well-Architected Scorecard for products will be tracked in the goal review meetings run by the Portfolio Team, so teams should communicate their goals and progress to their Bet / Goal owners.</p><p>Ready to get started?

	<h3 id="question9"><b>Can I self-assess the rest of my products?</b></h3><br>
	<p>Since this is a tech initiative, products should be assessed by a tech lead on the team who has already been trained to ensure we get a consistent baseline reading across all products. As this is an early version of the Well-Architected Scorecard model there are a few things that require explanation, as they might be ambiguous and open to interpretation, so we are requiring that all new teams are guided if it’s their first time. Moving forward they can maintain their scores and assess any new products created in the future.</p><p>Please read through the <a href="https://contegixapp1.livenation.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?title=How+to+schedule+a+Tech+Maturity+Assessment&spaceKey=AWS">How to Schedule a Well-Architected Scorecard assessment</a> page before proceeding on your own.</p><br>

	<h3 id="question10"><b>How do I get my information updated?</b></h3><br>
	<p><b>Product information</b> - send an email outlining the changes to <a href="mailto:productinventory@ticketmaster.com">productinventory@ticketmaster.com</a> which will go into the TOC JIRA queue. Please include "Product Inventory Change Request" in the subject line. The request must include: the full product name, the desired field to change and the exact value that should be set. <br> <b>Well-Architected Scorecard scores</b> - Teams can self-manage this data in the system by viewing their product and clicking on the link at the top right which says "Edit Scores".
